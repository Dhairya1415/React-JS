This repository consists of three projects which i have been working on. These projects are
1] Github battle - In this i have used github api to get details of users and display them and declare winner depending on the public repos, followers and following. I haven't completed this project but intend to complete it after practicals.
2] Weather App - In this i have used openweathermap api to get weather details of a particular city by getting the city and country as input from user. I haven't applied styling to this project.
3] React Router - It is a very basic project to learn about react router.
